  			<dd><span class="item-title">Intermediate Software Developer&thinsp;&ndash;&thinsp; Connor Clark And Lunn Financial Group, Vancouver BC</span>
				<p>Program and support applications for the quantitative equity team along with a small group of three other
				developers. We manage approximately 100,000 lines of Java code across 20 applications. Development is primarily done in Java, but included some Excel VBA, and Q (KDB database). The proprietary software was a highly complex collection of tools and reports to get data from data providers, analyze stocks and produce and optimize the buy/sell orders which the traders executed.</p> 
				<p>I also support the trading systems by managing software they use to place orders as well as post trade processes. This is primarily advanced Excel VBA code and spreadsheets, VBScript, and SQL.</p>

  			<dt>2006 &thinsp;&ndash;&thinsp;Present</dt> 
  			<dd><span class="item-title">Director&thinsp;&ndash;&thinsp;Halotis Technologies, Vancouver BC</span> 
  				<p>Part-time work for my own HalOtis Technologies business. I created and designed over 30 unique
				websites and focused primarily on promoting CPA (Cost Per Action) and affiliate sales. I maintain a internet marketing related blog at <a = href="http://www.halotis.com">halotis.com</a> as well as a personal blog at <a href="http://mattwarren.name">mattwarren.name</a>. I wrote a short ebook and all the content/sales materials for <a href="http://runtoloseweight.com">runtoloseweight.com</a>.</p>
				<p>I actively maintain Google Adwords campaigns using the Adwords Editor and several self developed Python scripts.</p>
				<p>Development is done in a mixed Mac OSX/Linux/Windows environment primarily with PHP and Python. Some of my more useful projects have included promotional scripts for automating blogs, scaling up and organizing Google Adwords campaigns, monitoring & scraping websites, and automating Twitter accounts.</p>

  			<dt>May 2004&thinsp;&ndash;&thinsp;May 2006</dt> 
  			<dd><span class="item-title">Software Engineer&thinsp;&ndash;&thinsp;Department of Fisheries and Oceans, St. John's NL</span> 
  				<p>Designed and wrote a graphical application in Java to analyze raw data from deep ocean probes. The
				final result was a program that was used by several people in the department to evaluate and work with the data.</p>
				<p>Also, I worked on an ocean forecasting system. It was a concurrent and parallel mathematical process that was distributed over several Solaris machines. It required writing Unix scripts to procure data from international partners. MatLab code to analyze satellite, radar, and other data. I helped debug the modeling code written in Fortran, wrote automation scripts and displayed generated charts and graphs on a website. I deployed a wiki, FTP server, set up apache for a web server, and administered a mixed Windows/Linux/Solaris environment.</p>
				<p>Another project I worked on as lead developer was an application written in MatLab to predict drift patterns of objects in the ocean to be used by the coast guard to locate people lost at sea.</p>
