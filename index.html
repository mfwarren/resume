				developers. We manage approximately 100,000 lines of Java code across 20 applications. Development is primarily done in Java, but included some Excel VBA, and Q (KDB database). The proprietary software was a highly complex collection of tools and reports to get data from data providers, analyze stocks and produce and optimize the buy/sell orders which the traders executed.</p> 
				<p>I also support the trading systems by managing software they use to place orders as well as post trade processes. This is primarily advanced Excel VBA code and spreadsheets, VBScript, PowerShell and SQL.
